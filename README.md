# Apparatus Procedure Executor (APE)

Automation middleware for accelerating integration and autonomy

maintaining the providence of the information used to run these machines.

## Getting started

Although it is not essential, it assumed that Anaconda has been installed as a
way to quickly get most of the necessary packages and IDE (Spyder).

Several example files of how APE can be used are in the Examples folders.

### First simulation run

Look in Examples/FlexPrinterMonolith folder and copy Example_Monolith.py and
TemplateTPGen.py into the root folder of APE (the same folder as this file).

Open Example_Monolith.py in an IDE of your choice.
